Paper trying to reframe the 'progress in philosophy' debate, articulating an instrumentalist take, hopefully drawing lines to make some empirical work on the issue.

###Main argument:###
    Philosophy's main value comes from the set of skills philosophers end up developing in studying and thinking about the problems of the discipline.
    (Maybe a weak version: There are good reason to think philosophy is instrumentally valuable, it posses an external justification)

###Secondary arguments:###
    – The value-of-philosophy question is more interesting/important/a better way to frame the issue than the progress-in-philosophy question.
    – In so far it receives public funds, philosophers have the duty of offering an external justification.
    – Ppl from humanities often offer poor external justifications—not good enough as to justify the amount of public funding they receive, which, arguably, should be proportional to the amount of public good a discipline is expected to bring.
    – 

###Important insights###
     **Useful distinctions**: intrinsic value – internal justification / instrumental value – external justification.
