On the Value of Philosophy
===========================


Paper that aims to reframe the 'progress in philosophy' debate, articulate an instrumentalist take on it, and provide guidelines to do some empirical work on the issue.


General notes:
--------------

– Really more interested on the question for the value of philosophy, which is a related but slightly different question (what is really interesting is the conative part of the notion of progress).
   + Views I don’t like: 
      + Truth/knowledge: “philosophy is valuable because sometimes philosophers come up with (approximately) true theories.”
         + There might be no fact of the matter about many salient philosophical problems.
      + Understanding: “philosophy might not deliver true theories, but might still improve our understanding of some issues”. (This seems to be the paper’s thesis.)
         + Is there any account of understanding that is not parasitic of ‘truth’/’knowledge’?
      + Cultural value stuff: “Humanities are important because of culture, culture is important because it makes us humans, blab la bla.”
         + Ok, philosophy might be valuable for the same reasons as literature is valuable, but… we deserve more funding! Why? Well, bc… (the thesis).
         + (Proper) philosophy has to be more valuable than stuff like literature (this is not that odd, consider that we fund literature and are—in general—ok with that, but wouldn’t be ok with funding, say, machitunes on the sole basis of its cultural value [could the fact that machitunes were originally conceived to play some causal role that we don’t believe anymore they play explain this difference? Maybe machitunes are a bad example?])

– About what we should take ‘value’/’valuable’ to be: smth along the lines of RPT and something that helps us to get things we value in the RPT sense—but we might well fail to see (have not learned yet) its instrumental value.

– Right view: philosophy has cultural and aesthetic value, but also, as a byproduct, instrumental value insofar doing philosophy develops ‘philosophical expertise’, which is a set of skills(?) that favors knowledge acquisition(?) when ppl invest it in doing other stuff (science, policy, decisions in general.)
   + Smth along the lines of conceptual engineering but more general
   + Smth smth, division of academic labor, smth smth.
   + Challenge: operationalize the notion of ‘philosophical expertise’ to make it empirically testable whether (i) philosophical training develops that; and (ii) it is a transferable, useful skill.
   + Evidence that such a thing exists is the fact that many sciences where philosophy before we came up with the means to access empirically to their phenomena of interest and philosophers did in general a good job building the relevant conceptual space (having come up with empirical methods is a sign of it.)
   + Think of the work of naturalistic/fringe philosophers that do “quasi science” studying factual issues that—because they are very hard to access empirically—are conceptually dense/heavy(?)
      + If the hypothesis is true, philosophers should be particularly good at this, whereas empirically oriented scientists should not.
      + Case of study: … (?).
– Philosophers have incentives to dig into problems that ppl from other disciplines don’t have incentives to dig into.
   + How to connect this observation?
   + Does this tell something about the “nature” of the discipline that could be relevant to the discussion?

– Maybe Happiness paradox could work as an analogy to illustrate some points?

– **Useful distinctions**:

   + Intrinsic value – internal justification / instrumental value – external justification.
   + Intrinsic value might steam from its epistemic, cultural and/or aesthetic value.
   + Organic contributions to science / useful skills 

– Philosophical skills are something on the lines of what enables ppl to do good conceptual engineering and/or get understanding of not-yet-well-conceptualized phenomena.

– Possible argument from rational reconstruction of philosophers to science (in the past, like physics, etc and more recent examples [see Glymour's naturalistic manifesto]). Important to note that contributions are way more subtle than usually portrayed and also expected for being justificatory (but are contributions enough).

Main argument:
----------------

Progress in the problems of the discipline is not a necessary condition for philosophy being valuable, since it's value seems mainly from the set of skills philosophers end up developing in studying and thinking about the problems of the discipline. Such a set of skills can be operationalized. They are transferable and incredibly useful in important contexts, this should be empirically testable. 


Secondary arguments:
---------------------

– The value-of-philosophy question is more interesting/important/a better way to frame the issue than the progress-in-philosophy question.

– In so far it receives public funds, philosophers have the duty of offering an external justification.

– Ppl from humanities often offer poor external justifications—not good enough as to justify the amount of public funding they receive, which, arguably, should be proportional to the amount of public good a discipline is expected to bring.

– A strong defense of philosophy's value should assume that there might be no fact of the matter regarding the big problems of philosophy.

– Philosophical expertise should not be characterized in terms of knowledge, but in terms of a certain set of skills.

– Facts about the nature of philosophical problems, the academic division of labour and institutional incentives support the main thesis.

– Empirical work must be done to fully support the main thesis. It can be done.
